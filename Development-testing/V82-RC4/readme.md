These are beta test files for Revision V82. 

This is Release Candidate 4 (RC4) that combines all the older files and replaced with changed files from the V82RC builds. 

The following files have changed from the previous build from V81 and older.

- Split Screw Post Mount - new carriage mounting system
- LED_Carrier_LDO - tighter tolerance for better fit
- NH36 Mounting Bracket - Slimmer design for better wire management
- NH36 Mounting Bracket Strain Relief Offset - new tube offset that keeps it away from main cable
- Shroud Body - Wire channel updates and deeper channels
- Blade Holder LDO - new print orientation to make it stronger and easier to install
- Conch Mount - Corrected for some misalignment issues if screws were too tight
- Bearing Install Cap - smaller install cap so it can be used for installing bearings in both motor and mid-body
- Mid Body ECAS - geometry and engineering changes to improve flow (improvements made to address poorly tuned prints or to compensate for build quality). Improvement made will also increase the life of kinetic parts. ECAS body and future P4-M10 bodies have been strengthened.
- Motor Mount - geometry and engineering changes to match improvements made in the Mid Body. Additional counter measures adjusted to motor mounts to prevent over tightening of gear.
- Guidler - adjusted geometry to compensate for improvements made in the Mid body
