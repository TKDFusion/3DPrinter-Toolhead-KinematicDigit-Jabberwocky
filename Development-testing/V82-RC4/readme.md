These are early release test files for Revision V82 (Codenamed Steve's Updates), but are thoroughly tested and near release. 

This is Release Candidate 4 (RC4), which combines all older files and replaces them with the changed files from the V82RC builds. 

The following files have changed from the previous build of V81 and older.

- Split Screw Post Mount - new carriage mounting system
- Front mount block plate - now includes a keyhole so the mount screw can be preinstalled in the conch mount to receive it
- LED_Carrier_LDO - tighter tolerance for better fit
- NH36 Mounting Bracket - Slimmer design for better wire management
- NH36 Mounting Bracket Strain Relief Offset - new tube offset that keeps it away from the main cable
- Shroud Body - Wire channel updates and deeper channels
- Blade Holder LDO - new print orientation to make it stronger and easier to install
- Conch Mount - Corrected for some misalignment issues if the screws were too tight. The mount screw can now be partially preloaded to make installation on the carriage mount easier.
- Bearing Install Cap - smaller install cap so it can be used for installing bearings in both motor and mid-body
- Mid Body ECAS - geometry and engineering changes to improve flow (improvements made to address poorly tuned prints or to compensate for build quality). The improvements made will also extend the life of the kinetic parts. ECAS body and future P4-M10 bodies have been strengthened.
- Motor Mount - geometry and engineering changes to match improvements made in the Mid Body. Additional countermeasures adjusted to motor mounts to prevent over-tightening of the gear.
- Guidler - adjusted geometry to compensate for improvements made in the mid-body
