**CABLE CHAIN SUPPORT FOR JABBERWOCKY**
This is still under testing.

Cable/Drag Chain support is now ready for active testing for Jabberwocky. The mod allows for stock cable chains to be used, or if you feel like getting fancy, I've designed new cable chains that limit the bend radius to 40° or a minimum bend diameter of 50mm to avoid the break point of most wires, which is around 40 mm. 

The mod requires a horizontal adapter that converts the XY Joint to allow for a horizontal chain. A new electronics mount that accepts the horizontal cable chain that has a limiter to allow it to hinge and open when servicing the toolhead. You will need to use two-hole anchors for interfacing with JW so it pivots properly, but there are several cable chain anchors to select to make yours work if you're using the three-hole cable chains that step down to two. 

Start with the fixed wire channel (currently will work with 250-350 builds). and either use your old cable chains and attach directly to the fixed wire channel, or count how many links you need and print the required amount. 

The clips twist in or use a table to push them in, but I recommend just twisting one side and leaving the other open to load wire. When chains are assembled, work them around the radius of the chain to get it working smoothly. It will be stiff at first, but it will get smoother the more you work it.
